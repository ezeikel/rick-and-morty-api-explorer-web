# Rick and Morty API Explorer

## Still TODO

- Use Server Components instead of `useQuery` hooks and Client Components where possible
- Refactor code to be less repetitive and more modular (e.g., create more reusable components)
- Enable navigation between linked entities (e.g., from character detail page to episodes featuring that character, and vice versa)
- Implement animations for a better user experience
- Fix existing tests
- Add more tests to improve coverage and reliability
- Add ESLint for consistent code style and quality
